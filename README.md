# MusiSort : Using K-Means Clustering to automatically categorize digital music files.

# Abstract

Downloading music is done by many different people for many different reasons, whether it be for backups, data hoarding, or to listen to music while offline. However, those who do download music, come across the issue of organizing all the files into categories that they can reference when needed. The most known way to organize music is by genres. The issue with genres however, is that they are set by humans and liable to be incorrect, or there could be no genre assigned to the audio file based on how it was retrieved. Currently, if you want to find what genre a song belongs to, you have to manually search for it online and assign it to the song through a tool. While this may work for a short list of songs, if you have a larger list (say about 1000 songs), this process becomes much more time consuming. MusiSort aims to fix this issue by automatically sorting songs into categories based not on genre, but by musical similarity. It accomplishes this task by utilizing new and known musical analysis methods to generate data and feed that information to K-Means Clustering to generate categories. Through this, MusiSort can take a large list of audio files, and separate them by melodies, tempo, mood, and more.

# Description

MusiSort is a tool being developed to collect music and put them into similar groups or clusters based on their waveform.  The program uses artifical intelligence to check similarities and differences between the different songs.  The main goal of the project is to create a tool which removes the need to manually sort music into different genres as this can be quite a difficult, and tedious, task.  

# Installation

As MusiSort is a pip tool, it can be easily installed with the help of Python and Pip through the following command:

`pip install musisort`

MusiSort files are stored under the user directory as `musisort`.  For instance, on windows, `C:\\Users\\ComputerName\\AppData\\Local\\user\\musisort`.

# Usage

**MusiSort Command Line Interface**

There are a total of 7 different commands currently available to use in musisort. The following is a list of each command:

- musisort help
- musisort info <command>
- musisort dir
- musisort config <key> <value>
- musisort analyze
- musisort classify <list_name> <cluster_count>
- musisort debug

`help`  : displays the commands in musisort along with a description of what each one does.
`info`  : when used with a command as an argument, displays a more in-depth description of the command compared to the help menu.
`dir`   : lists all directories on the system associated with MusiSort.
`config`: when used without arguments, shows current config values in the terminal. If used with the key and value arguments, changes that key's value in the config.
`analyze`: retrieves song data from the folder `all\songs` and uses the classes under the analysis_methods folder in MusiSort's code to analyze each song.
`classify`: takes song's stored in the list/folder specified in the arguments and clusters them based on the amount given in the command.  To classify, each song in the list must first be analyzed with the analyze command.
`debug` : uses a song located in the debug folder of MusiSort's directory to run tests and check MusiSort's performance\accuracy.

**Using MusiSort to Classify Songs**

# Current Development State

[‚úÖ] Develop the algorithm to sort songs into categories.

[‚úÖ] Optimize the algorithms used to sort songs for faster completion.

[‚úÖ] Create a more user friendly terminal interface for easier usage.

[‚úÖ] Display list of labels in terminal after classification has finished.

[‚úÖ] Develop framework for testing accuracy of data analysis methods and classification. - Current Release 1.0

[üèóÔ∏è] Add option to append classification labels onto audio file's metadata genre tag.

[üèóÔ∏è] Explore implementation of other clustering methods.

[‚ùå] Develop a GUI for more interactivity with the program.
